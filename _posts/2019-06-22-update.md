title: First Post and Development Update
---

It has been a while since I last updated this project with any new material, but better late than never! A lot has
happened since I initially set up this site, which also calls for some updates to my
[impossible list](https://bormanjo.github.io/impossible-list/) and some remarks about current projects under
development.

#### Development Update - Market Monitor

Lately, I have made decent progress building out the [Financial Market Monitor](https://github.com/bormanjo/markets-monitor)
dashboard. Over the last six months I spent time developing a financial data dashboard with Plotly's `Dash` python
package. The intent behind this dashboard is to integrate a variety of data sources into an interactive and potentially
customizable interface. At the moment I am running this dashboard locally via a Docker container, but in the long run I
intend to deploy the container to a server with a public IP.

The front end UI and back end processing components are coming along quite well. After IEX updated their `iexfinance`
module to require authentication via the IEX Cloud in order to provide data services, I thought it was best to switch to
another data provide for historical and intraday equity data. I decided to switch back to Yahoo Finance as the tried and
true data source. The `yfinance` Python module provides a solid, lightweight interface to Yahoo Finance's data API.
Additionally, the dashboard also references NASDAQ's FTP server for tickers listed on its exchange as well as WSJ's
RSS feeds for news cards. In regards to the front end UI, the `dash-bootstrap-components` module has been an outstanding
addition to the app in terms of organizing a fluid structure and design across all panels.
