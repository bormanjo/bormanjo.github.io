title: Recreating the Classics 2 - Snake
---

Since my [last post](https://bormanjo.github.io/2020/03/29/pypong/) I have been
following my interest in recreating the video game classics and then implementing
bots to play them. In this post I cover a game I used to play on flip phones as a kid: Snake

Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/bormanjo/py-snake)

### Development

**The Snake** - consists of a list of sequential `board` spaces that comprise the `player`'s position. The capacity of spaces remains fixed until the `snake` consumes a food space and increases by one. A FIFO priority (first-in first-out) queue is the ideal representation of this object since it naturallymimics the desired functionality. Each element in the queue consists of a space on the board. During each moment the `snake.adds()` (enqueues) the next `space` and simultaneously `pops()` (dequeues) the last `space`.

**The Board** - similar to the `snake` object, is also a container of `space`s but in matrix form. The `snake` functions by storing coordinate references to `space`s on the `board`. When the `snake.draw()` method is
invoked it accesses the `space` object at `board[x, y]`. While the `board`'s state is mostly static, the food space is the only dynamic element. Each time a food space is consumed another is randomly identified and drawn.

### Game/Bot Demo

![Pong Demo](https://github.com/bormanjo/py-snake/blob/master/demo.gif?raw=true)

The demo above depicts the `AIPlayer` navigating to the food space using Dijkstra's Algorithm to
identify the shortest path (red line). At each increment of 1,000 points the speed of the game increases by 1. This
creates additional difficulty for the `HumanPlayer` as the user must constantly asses which move it will (or won't)
make. After consuming a food space, the `AIPlayer` searches for the next food space to traverse to. The movement delay
after each consumed food space is the algorithm running.

#### AIPlayer Decisions

If a `path_step` exists then increment to take the next step, otherwise if missing then find a new `path` to the food
space and initialize `path_step` to 0. If the `path` is not missing and steps are still available then take the next
step by:

- Calculating the `delta` required to get to the next coordinate in the `path`
- Map the `delta` -> a keyboard control
- update the `last_key` state

The bot's decision is been registered when the `last_key` state variable is updated, otherwise the previous
decision stored in `last_key` remains in effect. When the `game._loop()` progresses to `_move()` objects the
`Player` object will make a movement based on the `last_key` attribute.

```python
def react_to(self, **kwargs):
    # Path step missing -> find new path
    if self.path_step is None:
        food = self.find_food()
        if food is None:
            return

        self.path = self.find_path(food)
        self.path_step = 0
    else:
        # Otherwise increment path step
        self.path_step += 1

    # If path is missing or no step to take -> no decision
    if self.path is None or len(self.path) <= 1:
        return

    # If still steps to take -> take step
    if self.path_step < len(self.path) - 1:
        i = self.path_step
        delta = self.get_delta(self.path[i], self.path[i+1])
        self.last_key = self.get_key(delta)
    else:
        # Otherwise reset path step -> calculate new step on next loop
        self.log.warn(f'No steps left to take')
```

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm

The code below is a condensed excerpt from the `AIPlayer` class. The premise of the algorithm is to identify the
shortest path between the `starting_node` and the `target_node` by iterating through the set of `unvisited` nodes.
Neighboring nodes are identified as candidates for traversal when they are in the `unvisited` set and have the
`minimum` distance to the `starting_node` out of all nodes in that set. Each step is recorded in the `prev`ious
dictionary mapping the current node to the previous node. When the `target_node` is reached, the algo iterates
backwards from the `target_node` to the `starting_node` using the mapping of `prev`ious nodes and finally returning
the shortest path.

```python
# Helper Functions
def min_distance_node(unvisited) -> tuple:
    ''''Returns the unvisited node with minimum distance to the source'''

def is_valid(node) -> bool:
    '''True/False: node is on the board and not in the snake'''

def get_neighbors(node) -> list:
    '''Returns a list valid neighboring nodes'''

# Algorith
def find_path(self, target_node):
    '''
    Finds the shortest path from the head node to the target node
    using Dijkstra's Algorithm
    '''
    starting_node = self.head()

    # Set of all visited nodes
    unvisited = {(x, y) for x in range(self.board.width)
                    for y in range(self.board.length)}

    # Init distances to all nodes as Inf
    distances = {
        (x, y): Inf
        for x in range(self.board.width)
        for y in range(self.board.length)
    }
    # Dict of node previous to key
    prev = {}

    # Init distance to starting node as 0
    distances[starting_node] = 0

    path = []

    while len(unvisited) != 0:
        node = min_distance_node(unvisited)     # Proceed to unvisted node w/ min distance from source
        unvisited.remove(node)                  # Mark as visited

        # For each neighbor
        for nb_node in get_neighbors(node):
            new_distance = distances[node] + 1  # Calc dist
            if new_distance < distances[nb_node]:
                distances[nb_node] = new_distance   # Update w/ better path
                prev[nb_node] = node                # Log/update prev node

        if node == target_node and prev.get(node, None) is not None:
            # iterate backwards over nodes for shortest path
            while node is not None:
                path = [node] + path
                node = prev[node]
                if node == starting_node:
                    path = [node] + path
                    break

    return path
```

### Final Thoughts

After building and watching the bot it occurred to me that Snake is more than a shortest path problem.
As human players we have to exert focus on both strategy *and* timely execution, while bots
automatically handle the execution. Instead, a bot's success is determined by a robust and clearly
articulated strategy via code. For the bot, execution is just taking a step along a previously
optimized path. A human instead needs to swiftly enter the correct key-strokes at the right time or
risk a mistake that will perpetually affect future moves and strategies.

Of all possible approaches, starting with a *simple* algorithm that prioritizes navigating the board
to find that next food space is a logical first step. Only after watching the algorithm work its
"magic" do the shortcomings of this decision process quickly become apparent. Once the size of the
snake is approximately the length of the board the bot begins to inadvertently trap itself or block
off sections of the board restricting path search solutions. At this point, human intuition excels
at identifying a temporary path to expend time until the snake's tail has moved along and an
opportunity becomes available.

The main limitation of the current algorithm is that it only thinks ahead enough to navigate
to the next food space - as it was designed to do:

> **A1**:  
**Objective** - find minimum distance path from source to target

Currently, there is no constraint or calculation that accounts for the impact of current decisions
on future paths. Among future improvements, I imagine an incrementally better algorithm may attempt
to solve the following:

> **A2**:  
**Objective** - find minimum distance path from source to target  
**Constraint** - There exists a path from the target node to every other node on the board

While the constraint is not (yet) well defined, I believe it to be a sensible next step that addresses
the issue of not taking into account the locations of *future* food space locations when deciding the
current path. Other iterations could include a more general board navigation strategy that emphasizes
making decisions now that reduce path restrictions later or utilizing multiple shortest path solutions
in a more strategic way.

Regardless of strategy, the complexity of this game is proportional to the size of the snake and
eventually all algorithms/strategies will fail. The game will always end once the snake's size
equals the number of board spaces as there is no where else to move or for food to spawn. The best
algorithm is then that which consistently achieving higher scores through strategic, forward-looking
movements that account for both current and future board states.
