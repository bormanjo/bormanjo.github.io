title: Recreating the Classics 1 - Pong
---

Since the usual activities of daily life have effectively come to a screeching halt due to Covid-19, I have finally found some spare time to return to some fun coding projects. What better a place to start than with one of the all time classics: Pong.

Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/bormanjo/py-pong)

#### Development

Personally most of my dev time is geared towards data science and systems processes, so putting time into a graphics-oriented project like Pong was a refreshing change. Data science tends to be functional in design as opposed to object oriented (with some exceptions) whereas a game like Pong is ripe for abstraction. Abstraction through inheritance greatly simplified the development process.

I had initially started on this project some three or four weeks back where I familiarized myself with the basics of `pygame`'s module such as rendering, moving and controlling objects on the screen. Returning to the project this weekend, I was able to jump right into refining the rough edges thanks to the various levels of abstraction. I began refining the game's main event loop and higher level functionality as well as displaying the immediate trajectory of the ball and creating a simple AI to play against.

#### The Game

![Pong Demo](https://github.com/bormanjo/py-pong/blob/master/demo.gif?raw=true)

The gif demo shows the live-action bout of a human player against the notorious PongBot. When the ball reflects off the left or right wall, the player of the opposite side receives a point. The bot's movements are determined by the vertical difference between the ball and paddle: if the ball is above the paddle then move up. The only real strategy to beat the bot here is to angle the shot towards the top or bottom corner.

```python
class AIPlayer(Player):
    def react_to(self, **kwargs):
        ball = kwargs.get('ball', None)

        if ball is None:
            return

        vert_dist = self.get_vertical_distance(ball)

        if vert_dist > 0:
            self.last_key = self.controls['down']
        elif vert_dist < 0:
            self.last_key = self.controls['up']
        elif round(vert_dist, 0) == 0:
            self.last_key = None

    def get_vertical_distance(self, ball):
        ball_pos = ball.rect.center
        my_pos = self.rect.center

        return ball_pos[1] - my_pos[1]
```

#### Final Thoughts

While there are a number of components still needing attention, the current version is a perfect 1.0 milestone to showcase. Items to consider for future updates are design improvements such as adding a menu and graphical config as well as increasing the complexity of the game itself by levelling the AI and adding other objects like barriers/powerups.
