## About Me

I am a Quantitative Researcher and Developer with a passion for data science, mathematics and programming.

Having experience across the financial industry in working for international broker-dealers, startups
and hedge funds has been invaluable in contributing to my own professional development. I currently work on trading systems for a quant equity hedge fund in NYC building system processes, recs/data checks, trading analytics and research reports.
