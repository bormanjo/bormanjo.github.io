## About Me
Hello and welcome to my personal website! I am a Quantitative Researcher and Developer located in 
NYC with a passion for data science, mathematics and programming.

Having experience across the financial industry in working for international broker-dealers, startups 
and hedge funds has been invaluable in contributing to my own professional development. Professionally,
I have developed in **`R`** and **`Python`** to construct dashboards and software libraries as well as automate 
processes to generate reports, analytics and monitor for real-time events.
